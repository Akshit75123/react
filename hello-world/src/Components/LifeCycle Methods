Lifecycle Methods -->

four types of Lifecycle methods
1. Mounting Lifecycle methods -- When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM.
four methods are :-
 a). constructor
 b). static getDerivedStateFromProps
 c). render
 d). componentDidMount

2. Updating Lifecycle methods -- When a component is bring re-rendered as a result of changes to either its props or state
five methods are :-
 a). static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) - Method is called every time a component is re-rendered, it also set the state
 b). shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) - dictates if the component should re-render or not.
        used for performance optimization
        avoid cause side-effects and calling the setState method.

 c). render
 d). getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)
 e). componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot) -- called after the render is finished in the re-render cycles
        can make ajax calls

3. Unmounting Lifecycle methods -- When a component is being removed from the DOM
method is componentWillUnmount

4. Error Handling methods -- When there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child of any child component
methods are -:
 a). static getDerivedStateFromError
 b). componentDidCatch
